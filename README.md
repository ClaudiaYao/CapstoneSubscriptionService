## Capstone Subscription Service

### How to run the system

First, start the Colima by typing "colima start" in command line

1. type **make tools** to install the necessary tools, such as Goose and sqlc

Note: Goose is used to manage sql migration (including the creation of database tables),
sqlc is used to generate sql queries and database related code automatically.
the code generated by sqlc is put under resources/database/sqlc/internal

2. type **make up_build** to build the application and run docker-compose.yml to load all
   the dependencies

3. type **make migrateup** to create database tables.
   > Note: for this step, if you meet permission or authentication errors, check in terminal window as below steps

- type "sudo lsof -i tcp:5432"
- type "sudo kill -9 <pid-number>"
- Then type "make migrateup" again

4. type **make copy_data** to copy sample data to subscription-postgres container.

5. Open postman, and try to test the micro-service

   - Get, http://localhost:8081, return a welcome message
   - Get, http://localhost:8081/subscription/user/user6, return all the subscriptions of the user 6. from the sample data
   - Other queries, please see the Postman shared workspace.

6. type **make down** to stop the system.

# Other usage:

### Generate Data

type **make generate_data** to generate a new batch of sample data, which will override the
original sample data.

### Generate one subscription post data to test Posting functionality

type **make generate_one_sub_post** and then copy the JSON file in the command window and post it to
Postman for testing.

### Use sqlc to generate SQL Queries

This task is not done automatically. Just follow these steps:

- Change work directory to resouces/database/sqlc
- Add your query to query.sql
- type "sqlc generate"

> You will see the automatically generated files under resources/database/sqlc/internal. Copy the code snippet to the .go files when you need them.

> You might refer to [sqlc documentation] (https://docs.sqlc.dev/en/stable/) for more information.

### Note

after updating to the colima,
volume of the postgresql is not supported, so
remove the following two lines from the docker-compose.yml

    volumes:
      - ./db-data/postgres/:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
